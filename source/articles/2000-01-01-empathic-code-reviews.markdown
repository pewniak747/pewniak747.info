<!-- Introduction -->

*Disclaimer: opinions expressed here are my own.*

Code review is seemingly a staple of programming industry: most of the people agree it's useful, and many teams actually do it.
However, code reviews can still be a stressful experience, leading some to doubt its usefullness.
There are many resources available on how to perform code reviews (process, tools etc.), but rarely it's written about how to *actually* perform a review on a more human level -- how to write and communicate our ideas during review.

In this post I'll try to highlight some of the techniques I use in my daily work, to make code reviews efficient while also being enjoyable. These work rather well for me and the context of my teams, but Your Mileage May Vary - let me know your thoughts.

<!-- NOTES
* Give constructive feedback
  * professionalism, constructive feedback are meaningless terms
  * be strict, but professional
  * higlight next possible steps (solution, improvement, consulting, delegation)
  * give reasons for change
  * the power of example
  * give praise when praise is due
  * responding to bad code
  * understand the context & constraints (time, author knowledge, reviewer knowledge)
  * benefits of empathic code review: more acceptance rate, virtuous cycle
* Language
  * Use english
  * Avoid loaded words, mockery, condescension
  * Don't express opinions as facts
  * End with a question to encourage a reply
  * Discourage individual code ownership when criticising
* Teamwork
  * sources of code attachment: author's complex, caring about the result
  * aim to reduce attachment to code
  * ultimately it's impossible to silence emotions, but work can be done from both sides (reviewer, reviewee)
  * acknowledge the impact of emotions
  * don't write review comments when agitated
  * don't treat code review as a duel to be won
* Possible objections

## Language

Skillful use of language is useful in performing code reviews in many ways. It is important, because in this context, written word is the only means of communication. We don't have access to other cues that influence our understanding (body language, facial expressions, tone of voice etc.).

Luckily, written word can be more easily controlled, and used to our advantage. There are a number of small things that can be done to improve code reviews with correct use of language:

### Use english

If english is your native language, good! If not, it's worth performing code reviews in english.

<!-- TODO: source -->
There are studies that show that people are more logical and calm when not using their native language.
We also tend to give a little more thought before writing in a foreign language - it may not be as effortless. It's useful in code review to think your comment through before submitting it.

Additionally, assuming the source code and tooling is written in english, there will be less awkward loanwords (words borrowed from foreign language used in native context).

Needless to say, for this to work, the entire team must be in good command of written english. That's the basis of being able to communicate effectively.

### Avoid loaded language

### Expressing opinions

### End with a question
